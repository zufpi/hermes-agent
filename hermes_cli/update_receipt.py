"""Structured update receipts + post-update fleet version verification.

Phase 1 of the fleet-update reliability plan (#91277): the updater must
*prove* its outcome instead of assuming it.

Two additive capabilities, both designed so a failure inside them can never
break an update (every public entry point is exception-swallowing):

1. **Update receipt** — a machine-readable JSON record of what one
   ``hermes update`` run discovered, did, skipped (and why), written to
   ``<HERMES_HOME>/logs/update_receipts/``. Silent-failure classes this
   makes visible: #88848 (helper died after "success" printed), #74973
   (restart silently skipped), #85753 (restart phase never ran), #81193
   (desktop shows failure for a successful update).

2. **Fleet version verification** — after the restart phase, read every
   profile's ``gateway_state.json``, compare each live gateway's stamped
   ``code_sha`` (written by ``gateway/status.py`` on every runtime-status
   write) against the freshly-updated checkout's HEAD, and print a fleet
   version matrix. Mixed-version fleets (#88654, #69754, #77553, #56717)
   become a loud, actionable report instead of a latent state.

Deployment-kind awareness (docker/image-managed installs) rides on
``hermes_cli.version_info.get_code_identity()``: a packaged build reports
its install-stamp provenance (``source="docker"``/``"nix"``/…) and the
receipt records that the install is not in-place updatable.

    ``self_restart_pending`` — pids of gateways that are ancestors of this updater and accepted a
    self-restart request (cron update inside the gateway tree, #100179). They can only restart after
    this process exits, so their pre-update ``code_sha`` is expected: such a row is
    ``restart_pending`` instead of ``stale`` and does not fail the matrix (#119597). Every other
    live gateway on the old sha keeps its ``stale`` verdict.

    Rollout safety: ``down`` requires membership in ``pre_restart_pids`` — a stale state file from a
    long-dead gateway (machine reboot, manual kill weeks ago) must NOT fail every future update.
    Without a pre-restart snapshot (``None``/empty) dead PIDs are skipped (historical behavior).

    ``stale``   — gateway stamped a code_sha that differs from the updated checkout's HEAD (it is still
    serving pre-update modules). ``unknown`` — gateway predates the code-identity stamp (started before this
    feature landed), identity could not be resolved, or the state file's live PID is not the
    verified gateway for that home (``live_gateway_pid_for_home``): ``write_runtime_status`` re-stamps
    ``pid``/``code_sha`` for whatever process writes it, so a foreign writer must never read as
    ``current`` (#110420, sibling of #109680). ``down``    — the gateway was ALIVE when this update
    started (``pre_restart_pids``), its runtime status still says running, but the PID is dead and no
    successor rewrote the record: the restart phase stopped it and nothing came back. Without this row a
    killed-and-never-replaced gateway produced NO entry at all and the matrix passed silently (Phase-1
    verification gap, #88848/#74973 class).
