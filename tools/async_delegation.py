"""Async (background) delegation registry behind ``delegate_task(background=true)``.

The parent dispatches a subagent on a module-level daemon executor and returns a handle
immediately. On completion a ``type="async_delegation"`` event (self-contained task-source
block) is pushed onto the SHARED ``process_registry.completion_queue`` the CLI/gateway drain
while idle, so results surface as a NEW turn (never mid-turn) and inherit its de-dup and
crash-recovery wiring. Only the async lifecycle lives here; the child run is an injected ``runner``."""
