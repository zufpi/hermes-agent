"""Manual runs of a satellite job that delivers through the primary gateway's profile route.

Regression for #120330. A multiplexed satellite profile with no ``platforms.<p>`` credential of
its own posts through the primary's bot via a root ``gateway.profile_routes`` entry, so only the
gateway process holding that bot can deliver its jobs. ``hermes -p <profile> cron run`` used to
run the whole agent turn in the CLI process anyway, fail delivery with ``platform 'telegram' not
configured/enabled`` and overwrite the job's ``last_status`` with ``delivery_failed``.
