"""Per-platform slash command access control.

A second axis beside ``allow_from``: of the users allowed to talk to the gateway, which may run
which slash commands. Two lists per scope (DM vs group, mirroring ``allow_from`` /
``group_allow_from``): ``allow_admin_from`` (user IDs that get every registered command, built-in
and plugin) and ``user_allowed_commands`` (names non-admins may run; empty/unset -> only the
``_ALWAYS_ALLOWED_FOR_USERS`` floor). No ``allow_admin_from`` for a scope => gating disabled there,
so existing installs are unaffected until an operator lists an admin. Applied at the dispatch
site in ``gateway/run.py`` via the live registry; never affects plain chat.
