# --- Wedged-gateway detection + bounded escalation ---------------------------
# A gateway whose asyncio loop is stalled cannot handle SIGTERM/SIGUSR1, so the drain wait burns
# its full budget and `hermes update` can deadlock. Two witnesses classify the loop BEFORE any
# drain wait: the heartbeat file ``state/gateway.heartbeat`` (rewritten every 30s on a thread, so
# staleness alone is not proof) and the loop-tick socket ``state/gateway.loop-tick.<pid>.sock``
# answered by the loop itself; the payload records whether the socket is armed (``loop_tick_socket``).
# ``alive``: socket answered, or fresh file not contradicted -> normal graceful drain. ``wedged``:
# heartbeat is this PID's, stale past several beats, AND the armed socket stays silent across
# ``tick_strikes`` consecutive misses -> callers may ``_escalate_wedged_gateway``; one silent probe
# is never authority. ``unknown``: no/unreadable heartbeat, PID mismatch, or witness conflict ->
# treated as alive; never escalate on ambiguity. Legacy payloads (no ``loop_tick_socket`` flag)
# wrote on-loop, so staleness alone remains proof.

# --- Wedged-gateway detection + bounded escalation (#81642) ----------------- A gateway whose asyncio loop
# is stalled (e.g. an in-loop compression pass, #72707) cannot process SIGTERM/SIGUSR1 shutdown: the drain
# wait then burns the full drain budget (180s by default), warns "still running after 180.0s — restart may
# fail", and `hermes update` can deadlock behind it. The loop publishes a liveness signal precisely for this
# case: an asyncio task rewrites ``state/gateway.heartbeat`` every 30s (#66892), so a frozen loop stops
# refreshing the file while a busy-but-alive loop keeps refreshing it. Since #90502 the heartbeat write runs
# on a thread (a stalling filesystem must not be able to block the loop the watchdog watches), which costs
# the file its status as *proof*: a stalled write or a saturated executor can age the file while the loop
# runs, and an off-loop write can land after the loop froze, keeping the file fresh for a dead loop. The
# loop therefore also arms a second witness — ``state/gateway.loop-tick.<pid>.sock``, a UNIX socket answered
# by the loop itself — and records whether it is armed in the heartbeat payload (``loop_tick_socket``).
# ``probe_gateway_loop_liveness`` reads both signals (a local stat + JSON read + a bounded socket ping,
# repeated up to ``tick_strikes`` times when a wedge is suspected — worst case ~3.4s, still far inside the
# 10s query tier of the subprocess timeout doc) and classifies the gateway BEFORE any drain wait begins: -
# ``alive``   — the loop answered the tick socket, or the file is fresh and the loop is not contradicted by
# the socket. Callers must take the normal graceful-drain path, which honours the in-flight cron drain floor
# (#86684). - ``wedged``  — the heartbeat belongs to this PID, is stale well past several missed beats, AND
# the tick socket is armed but stays silent across a sustained window of consecutive misses (default 3):
# both witnesses agree, sustained, that the loop is provably dead. One silent probe is never destructive
# authority — a transient synchronous stall can outlast a single recv timeout, so a lone miss falls to
# ``unknown``. Draining is pointless for a provably dead loop (nothing can run the drain), so callers may
# escalate immediately via ``_escalate_wedged_gateway``. - ``unknown`` — no heartbeat / unreadable / PID
# mismatch / witness conflict (fresh file with a silent loop, armed socket unreachable). Treated like
# ``alive``: never escalate on ambiguity. The distinction matters: only a *provably dead* loop may bypass
# the cron drain floor. A merely busy gateway still answers the probe (socket ping) and keeps its full drain
# budget — even when the filesystem is stalling the heartbeat write (the incident that motivated #90502).
