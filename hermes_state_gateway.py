        The mirror of :meth:`rekey_profile_state`: a rename must rekey a profile's identity, a
        delete must purge it. ``agent:<name>:*`` routing keys, ``gateway_heartbeats.profile``,
        ``delivery_obligations`` and the telegram topic tables are bookkeeping for a profile that
        no longer exists — left behind, every inbound event on a chat keyed to the deleted name
        enters the routing index, resolves a profile whose directory is gone, and logs
        ``Profile '<name>' does not exist`` on each event for the life of the store.

        What each store gets, and why:

        * Routing keys and heartbeat rows are hard-deleted — pure bookkeeping for a dead name.
        * ``delivery_obligations`` rows are **terminalized** (``state='abandoned'``), not deleted:
          a pending obligation is delivery state that should not vanish silently, and the ledger's
          own retention prunes abandoned rows. Delivered history is left as it was.
        * ``sessions`` rows are not deleted here: this helper settles identity, not history, and it
          does not decide what a delete leaves of a profile's conversation record — ``delete_profile``
          removes the profile's own home, ``state.db`` included, with the directory. Rows in a shared
          store keep whatever ownership they had; re-binding or archiving them belongs to the flow
          that recreates the name, not to this purge.

        ``running``, for one in-process dispatch — so a ``running`` row at watcher startup belongs to a
        PREVIOUS gateway that died mid-dispatch. It is poisonous: ``request_handoff`` only accepts
        NULL/``completed``/``failed``, so the session could never hand off again, with no error surfaced.
        Failing rather than re-queueing is deliberate: the dead gateway may already have switched the
        session key and dispatched the synthetic turn, so a blind retry risks double delivery; a clean
        terminal state the user can retry from is right."""
