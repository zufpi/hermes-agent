"""One gateway process must not hold two SessionDB handles on one state.db.

Regression coverage for #98573.  ``SessionStore`` and ``GatewayRunner`` each
cached a handle per resolved path, and both resolve the SAME
``_default_db_path()``.  The process therefore held two writer connections and
two independent read pools against one file, so the descriptor budget doubled
for nothing -- and doubled again per profile on a multiplexed gateway, until a
long-lived process passed the 256 soft ``RLIMIT_NOFILE`` a service manager
hands it and unrelated code paths started failing with EMFILE while the
process stayed alive.

The runner now borrows the store's handle and caches only the async wrapper.
Ownership follows: the store closes the connection, the runner does not.
